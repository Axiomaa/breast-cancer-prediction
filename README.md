## Project Overview
Breast cancer prediction is a significant problem in medical data analysis. This project uses a dataset of diagnostic features to train machine learning models that can classify cancer types. The project is built with Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results.
